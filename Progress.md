# Main chips

* FM (CMOS/YM3438) - Done
* VDP (YM7101) - C conversion is done, needs bugfixing
* Arbiter (Integrated YM6045C) - In progress
* IO Chip (Integrated YM6046) - In progress
* TMSS - In progress
* 68000 (NMOS) - Mostly functional, needs more testing, bugfixing and optimizations
* Z80 (NMOS) - Done, needs more testing and optimizations
